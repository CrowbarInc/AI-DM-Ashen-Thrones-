### Player

That missing patrol warning matters. What exactly does it say about where they were last seen?

### GM

I can point you toward the missing patrol notice on the board, not to a final door. After that, everyone points in different directions. Watch the guards reacting to the missing patrol rumor and see where the pressure is pushing people next.

## Turn 7

### Player

Fine. I'll follow the missing patrol rumor along that northwest mud track.

### GM

You arrive beside the old milestone that leans weathered and cracked along the northwest mud track. The road narrows here into scrub and pools of standing rainwater, and the earth around the stone is churned by faint, overlapping prints that fade into the brush. Ahead, the track continues for a short distance before rain and growth obscure the way forward. The path the missing patrol took ends here in uncertain terrain, offering no clear trail onward.

## Turn 8

### Player

After I start that way, I pause and check whether anything about the patrol warning has changed.

### GM

You start along the northwest mud track, beginning past the leaning, weathered stone milestone. Looking back and around the milestone once more, you find that the patrol warning remains unchanged. The muddy ground around the milestone still bears faint, overlapping footprints whose number, origin, and direction defy clear discernment. Beyond the stone, the track soon fades into dense brush and rain-soaked earth, obscuring any obvious trail or sign of the missing patrol’s passage.

I look around.

### GM

The muddy track beyond the leaning, weathered stone milestone stretches northwest, fading where rainwater and tangled brush obscure the way. The notice board nearby confirms that the missing patrol was last seen heading this way, past a cluster of crates. Around the gate, the crowd moves uneasily beneath spreads of rain-soaked banners, while a gate serjeant keeps a sharp eye on the bustling roster board. Threadbare watchers and ragged refugees huddle along the muddy line, their faces tight with persistent tension. The eastern caravan choke point remains clogged, the latest Ash Compact census delays contributing to the grinding congestion.

## Turn 14

### Player

I read the notice board again.

### GM
