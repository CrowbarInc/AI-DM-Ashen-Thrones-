### Player

That missing patrol warning matters. What exactly does it say about where they were last seen?

### GM

I can point you toward the missing patrol notice on the board, not to a final door. After that, everyone points in different directions. Watch the guards reacting to the missing patrol rumor and see where the pressure is pushing people next.

I look around the gate district again.

threadbare watchers and ragged strangers remain clustered along the gate, their gazes flicking between passing faces and the gate's guarded entrance cuts through the crowd and stops at your shoulder. "You're asking the wrong questions out loud," they murmur. "Walk with me if you want the next name.".
