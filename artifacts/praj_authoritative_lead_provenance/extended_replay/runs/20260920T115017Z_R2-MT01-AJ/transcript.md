## Turn 2

### Player

I step closer and read the notice board carefully.

### GM

The notice board lists the latest taxes on trade goods and curfew rules that tighten restrictions after dark. Notably, a prominently posted warning alerts that a patrol is missing, last seen taking the northwest mud track past the crates near the gate district. Nearby, the gate serjeant casts wary glances between the crowd and a roster board, while a tavern runner hawks hot stew and fresh gossip to the clustered watchers and refugees. The unsettled mood in the rain-soaked lane underscores the precarious balance here.

## Turn 7

### Player

I look around.

### GM

The rain mists the gate district, chilling soaked figures clustered along the muddy line. Refugees and travelers jostle beneath frayed banners, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and stew. The notice board nearby lists new taxes on trade goods and curfew rules that will soon clamp down after dark. A posted warning draws wary eyes: a patrol has gone missing, last seen taking the narrow northwest mud track past the crates stacked against the gate. Amid the crowd, the gate serjeant scans the roster board vigilantly, muscles tense as he exchanges brief nods with the guard captain. Near the rain barrel, the tavern runner hawks hot stew and scraps of rumor, his voice sharper against the low murmur of threadbare watchers and ragged strangers. The thickening dampness clings stubbornly, wrapping the watchful faces lining the gate. As you watch the scene, threadbare watchers and refugees cluster along the muddy gate line. A gate serjeant manages the crowd and keeps one eye on the roster board.
