### Player

That missing patrol warning matters. What exactly does it say about where they were last seen?

### GM

I can point you toward the missing patrol notice on the board, not to a final door. After that, everyone points in different directions. Find Tavern Runner and lock down where they were last seen speaking to anyone. I can point you toward the missing patrol notice on the board…
