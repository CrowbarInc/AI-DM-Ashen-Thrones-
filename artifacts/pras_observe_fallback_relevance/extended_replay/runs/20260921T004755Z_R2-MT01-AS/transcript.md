Objective: Learn the missing-patrol route, pursue it, investigate, return, observe, reread the board, bind the Guard Captain, receive a legitimate first-ask answer, inspect the referenced roster, look around, ask the tavern runner what stew costs, glance back at the notice board, ask who last checked that board, thank the runner and look toward the gate line, walk a few steps along the muddy gate line and listen, look around, look around again, look at the notice board, then take one more natural action.

## Turn 1

### Player

I look around the gate.

### GM

As you watch the scene, threadbare watchers and refugees cluster along the muddy gate line. A gate serjeant manages the crowd and keeps one eye on the roster board.

## Turn 2

### Player

I step closer and read the notice board carefully.

### GM

The notice board lists several key updates: newly imposed taxes and curfew rules tighten daily life around Cinderwatch. A warning about a missing patrol draws your attention; according to the board, the last sighting of the patrol was along the northwest mud track past the crates. Nearby, a gate serjeant keeps a watchful eye on the crowd and the roster board, while a tavern runner peddles hot stew and whispered rumors. Threadbare watchers and refugees mingle close to the muddy line, their faces drawn under the cold drizzle.

## Turn 3

### Player

Fine. I'll follow the missing patrol rumor along that northwest mud track.

### GM

You arrive at the Old Milestone, a weathered stone leaning beside the northwest mud track. The ground here is churned, marked by faint overlapping prints that fade into the scrub. Ahead, the muddy path narrows and soon becomes uncertain, obscured by rainwater and thick underbrush.

You step away from the notice board, rain streaking your cloak as the muddy throng presses closer. Around you, the gate serjeant remains fixed between the roster and the restless crowd, while the tavern runner’s calls drift faintly above the hum of voices. Threadbare watchers linger at the edges, their eyes sharp and restless despite their worn appearance.
