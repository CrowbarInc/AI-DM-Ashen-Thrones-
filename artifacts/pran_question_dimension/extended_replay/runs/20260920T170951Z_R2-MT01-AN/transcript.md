# R2-MT01-AN — notice_patrol_inquiry_return_captain_answer_roster_inspection_stew_relevance_world_action_question_sufficiency

Objective: Learn the missing-patrol route, pursue it, investigate, return, observe, reread the board, bind the Guard Captain, receive a legitimate first-ask answer, inspect the referenced roster, look around, ask the tavern runner what stew costs, glance back at the notice board, step back to ask who last checked that board, then take one more natural action.

## Turn 3

### Player

Fine. I'll follow the missing patrol rumor along that northwest mud track.

### GM

You arrive beside the old milestone along the northwest mud track. The stone marker, weathered by time, leans slightly to one side. Fresh mud churned with faint, overlapping footprints surrounds the base, fading into the scrub beyond. The track continues a short way past the milestone before becoming indistinct under rainwater and tangled brush. There is little sign of a clear path forward here.

## Turn 11

### Player

I look around the gate again after that.

### GM

You scan the gate area once more. The patchy crowd of threadbare watchers and ragged refugees jostles in the muddy lane, eyes flicking toward the roster board and the gate serjeant standing vigil there. The notice board remains pinned with the same terse listings—tax updates, curfew times, and the stark warning about the missing patrol last seen trudging the northwest mud track beyond piled crates. The gate serjeant’s vigilant gaze shifts between the crowd and roster, their expression tight with concern but yielding no new leads. Nearby, the tavern runner shouts softly about hot stew and whispers of rumors, but nothing breaks the quiet dread that lingers over the gate.

### Player

I glance back at the notice board after that.

### GM

The notice board remains unchanged, its list of taxes, curfews, and warnings about the missing patrol staring back at you. The gate serjeant continues his vigilant watch, eyes flicking between the roster and the restless crowd. No new entries have been added since your last look…

### Player
